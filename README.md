# Frontend mentor challenge solutions

 Hello, this is my solutions for [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). Each solution is in its own branch with its own history so to view the code for a specific project first switch to that project's branch.

## The projects

| Name and link to site | Code/Branch |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| [Intro section with dropdown navigation](https://01-intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation.netlify.app/) | [01-intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation](../../tree/01-intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation) |
| [Interactive rating component](https://02-interactive-rating-component.netlify.app/) | [02-interactive-rating-component](../../tree/02-interactive-rating-component) |
